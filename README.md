# First_one
This is my first repository, and I’ll be sharing my learning and progress here as I go.  
Currently, I am developing skills in:  
- Business Analytics/Data analytics  
- python  
- SQL(Structured query language)  
- dashboards(PowerBI, Tableau)  
- AWS & cloud fundamentals  
- Process Mining

Learning Git, GitHub, and building things one step at a time.
